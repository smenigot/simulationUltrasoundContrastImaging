# Simulation Frequency Optimization of Contrast to Tissue Ratio in Pulse Inversion Imaging 

This program can compute the CTR for an excitation in the inversion pulse imaging frame (PI) from the file propabulle.m. The first excitation (phase 0°) propagates nonlinearly in the medium. The backscattered tissue echoes are recorded as well as the incident pressure in the microbubble. The microbubble response is calculated by the model Marmottant. The attenuation due to the contrast agent concentration is added. Finally the signal from microbubbles is multiplied by the number of bubble corresponding to the dilution 1/2000 for the calculated volume. The second excitation of phase follows the same principle. Finally CTR is deducted.
